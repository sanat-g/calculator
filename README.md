# calculator

This calculator was a beginner project for myself to familiarize with JavaScript. Using basic lines of javascript code, I was able to create a fully functional calculator that displays in a HTML website. 

This project taught me the usage of JavaScript in back-end development and front-end, I was able to further augment my skills and move onto figuring out how react.js plays a role in web development.
